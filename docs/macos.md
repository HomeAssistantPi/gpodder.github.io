gPodder is now available as:
 - a macOS Application
 - a MacPorts port (See it [there](https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=gpodder))

If you're not already using MacPorts, the macOS application download is the recommended way to install gPodder.

Simply double-click to unzip the application, then copy `gPodder.app` to your `/Applications` folder.

Otherwise, using MacPorts, run `sudo port install gpodder +quartz`

Building the macOS application yourself
-----------------------------------

Code to generate the macOS application is hosted [here](https://github.com/elelay/gpodder-osx-bundle).
