### gPodder on Android

[thp](https://github.com/thp) has done some work on getting PySide to run on Android, which could potentially allow the QML UI of gPodder to run on Android: [PySide on Android](http://thp.io/2011/pyside-android/). Please note that this is not for the faint of the heart, and will require rooting of your Android device.
